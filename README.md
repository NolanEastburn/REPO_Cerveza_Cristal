# REPO_Cerveza_Cristal
A mod for the extraction horror game REPO that adds the Cerveza Cristal beer as well as some fun quirks.

This mod is heavily inspired by the [Cerveza Cristla Pilsner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerveza_Cristal) which is sold by [Compañía de las Cervecerías Unidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compa%C3%B1%C3%ADa_de_las_Cervecer%C3%ADas_Unidas). The beer has been embedded into internet meme culture from their [TV advertisements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force_is_with_Cristal_Beer) that transition seamlessly from various popular movies as they are being televised.
